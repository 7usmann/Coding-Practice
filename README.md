# LeetCode Demon

A collection of LeetCode algorithm practice solutions, organized by data structures and algorithmic techniques. This repository documents my journey through algorithmic problem solving and serves as a reference for future interviews and coding challenges.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into sections based on different data structures and algorithms:

- **ARRAYS**: Problems involving basic array manipulations
- **ARRAYS_TWO_POINTERS**: Problems solved using two-pointer technique
- **ARRAYS_SLIDING_WINDOW**: Problems solved using sliding window approach
- **BIT_MANIPULATION**: Bit manipulation problems
- **DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING**: Dynamic programming challenges
- **BACKTRACKING**: Backtracking algorithm problems
- **LINKED_LISTS**: Problems related to linked list data structure
- **STACKS**: Stack-based problem solving
- **QUEUES**: Queue-based problem solving
- **BINARY_TREES**: Binary tree traversal and manipulation
- **BINARY_SEARCH_TREES**: BST operations and algorithms
- **HEAPS**: Heap data structure problems
- **GRAPHS**: Graph traversal and algorithms

## Learning Approach

For each algorithm or technique learned, I'll implement solutions to contextually similar problems. This approach helps reinforce my understanding by applying techniques in different scenarios.
